// PanelLayout.swift — the persisted panel-layout contract shared by the macOS and
// iOS layouts in ContentView (#331 console default, #332 persistence).
//
// Two responsibilities, both deliberately free of SwiftUI:
//
//   1. The UserDefaults key namespace (`raymol.panels.*`). Both platform layouts
//      read the SAME keys through @AppStorage, so a pane's visibility survives a
//      relaunch — and, on a device that runs both idioms, means the same thing.
//   2. The sizing arithmetic. A size the USER chose is stored as a FRACTION of
//      the window dimension, never as absolute points: a height that was sensible
//      in a 1600pt window must not be restored into a 700pt one, where it would
//      leave no viewport. Fractions are clamped on the way in AND on the way out.
//      The untouched DEFAULT is the opposite — absolute points — so a console
//      nobody has resized looks the same on a laptop and on a 6K display.
//
// Everything here is a pure function of its arguments so PanelLayoutTests can
// pin the boundaries without a window.
